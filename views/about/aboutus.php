        <p class="about-text">Chuck Norris threw a grenade and killed 50 people. Then it exploded.
          Chuck Norris doesn’t read books. He stares them down until he gets the
          information he wants. Chuck Norris can clap with one hand. Chuck Norris
          once shattered the space-time continuum. He felt so bad, he put it back
          together. Death once had a near-Chuck-Norris experience.<br><br> If it looks
          like chicken, tastes like chicken, and feels like chicken but Chuck
          Norris says its beef, then it’s beef. The Great Wall of China was
          originally created to keep Chuck Norris out. It didn’t work. When Chuck
          Norris does a pushup, he’s pushing the Earth down. Chuck Norris once
          ordered a steak in a restaurant. The steak did what it was told. Chuck
          Norris makes onions cry. Chuck Norris has never blinked in his entire
          life. Never. Death once had a near-Chuck-Norris experience.<br><br> Chuck Norris
          beats rock, paper, scissors. Cannon balls, tanks, super destroyers,
          exploding stars — I could go on. If it looks like chicken, tastes like
          chicken, and feels like chicken but Chuck Norris says its beef, then
          it’s beef. Chuck Norris can strangle you with a cordless phone. Chuck
          Norris knows Victoria’s secret. Chuck Norris’ tears cure cancer.<br><br> Too bad
          he has never cried. When we first landed on the moon, the astronauts
          noted there was print on the moon that said “Chuck Norris was here.”.
          The dark is afraid of Chuck Norris. When God said, “Let there be light!”
          Chuck said, “Say Please.”.</p>
